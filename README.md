# MNES3D

...or "Modern NES 3D".

It's a(n) NES emulator written in ARM assembly for the
wondrous Nintendo 3DS. Why assembly? Because I wanted
something more challenging than C, and assembly is
just faster sometimes (in terms of program speed).

Uses devkitPro/ARM, ctrulib. Source code may or may
not be a trainwreck. Proceed with caution.
